# 📊 Manufacturing Efficiency Analytics – OEE Approach  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project evaluates **manufacturing process efficiency** using the industry-standard metric **OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)**.  
It integrates **Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI** to build an **end-to-end analytics workflow** for Availability, Performance, and Quality.  

The outcome is a **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes OEE trends, compares products/operators, and benchmarks results against the **world-class OEE target of 85%**.
